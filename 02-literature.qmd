# Brief history of seasonal adjustment methods

Revue de littérature sur les méthodes de désaisonnalisation, pourquoi on utilise JDemetra+, X-13/TRAMO-SEATS et pas d'autres méthodes

The most popular seasonal adjustment methods are TRAMO-SEATS[^1] [@gomez1996programs; @caporello2004program], a parametric method based on ARIMA models, and X-13ARIMA[^2] [@findleyx12; @ladiray1999x11en], a non-parametric method based on moving averages. 
Both methods are recommended by Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) for adjusting economic indicators. These two methods proceed in two steps, summarized in figure \@ref(fig:2-step-proc).

[^1]: The program TRAMO-SEATS was developed by Gianluca Caporello and Agustin Maravall --- with programming support from Domingo Perez and Roberto Lopez --- at the Bank of Spain. It is based on the program TRAMO-SEATS, previously developed by Victor Gomez and Agustin Maravall.

[^2]: The program X-13ARIMA is a produced, distributed, and maintained by the US-Census Bureau.

The **first step**, called **pre-adjustment** or **linearisation**, consists of pre-adjusting the time series by removing the deterministic effects and estimating missing observations. 
Next, in the **second part** of seasonal adjustment, called the **decomposition**, the pre-adjusted series is decomposed in order to determine the seasonal component. 
As a result of this process, the final seasonally adjusted series shall be free of seasonal and calendar-related movements.
 
The pre-adjustment step is very similar in X-13ARIMA and in TRAMO-SEATS (section \@ref(sec:pre-adjustment)), whereas the decomposition differs between the two methods. 
In X-13ARIMA, the X-11 algorithm decomposes the time series by means of linear filters (section \@ref(subsec:saX11)). 
In TRAMO-SEATS, SEATS (Signal Extraction in ARIMA Time Series) decomposes the observed series with a ARIMA-model based method (section \@ref(subsec:saSeats})).
